# 🌾 Project Samarth Prototype
### Prototype Project for **Build for Bharat Fellowship - 2026 Cohort (Data Science)**

---

## 📘 Overview

This project is a **Flask-based Question Answering (QA) Web Application** designed to analyze agricultural datasets and provide instant insights.  
Users can ask questions about crop production, rainfall patterns, and agricultural trends, and the system fetches relevant data from a SQLite database and presents clean tabular results.

This prototype was developed as part of the **Build for Bharat Fellowship 2026 (Data Science Track)** — focusing on empowering farmers and policymakers with easy access to data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Natural Question Understanding**  
  Ask questions in plain English like:  
  - “Compare production of Rice and Wheat”  
  - “Show trend of Maize”  
  - “Average annual rainfall for the last 5 years”

- 📊 **Dynamic Data Querying**  
  Automatically fetches relevant data from a SQLite database and computes averages, trends, and comparisons.

- 🌦️ **Multi-domain Support**  
  Works for both **crop production** and **climate data** (rainfall, etc.)

- 💬 **Interactive Web Interface**  
  Simple, fast, and responsive Flask frontend built with HTML + CSS + JS.

- 🧩 **Extendable**  
  Easy to add more question types or datasets (e.g., tea, wheat, sugarcane, etc.)
